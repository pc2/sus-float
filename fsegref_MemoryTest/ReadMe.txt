So i tried to just copy the example wrapper you gave us.
I think i still don't really understand how a wrapper works.
Here i tried to just take the wrapper sus-code from your example 
and copied the given code from the dedekind project just to check 
if any useable verilog code gets generated.
But as you can see there was nothing generated.
